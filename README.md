# hello-world

Hi humans,

I come from the Moon where people cann't live. We have spaceships but we don't have computers up there.
This time, I go to the Earth , as the Moon's ambassador, to learn about computers and coding steps. If not, my king will send his army to Earth and destroy the civilization of mankind and execute me. 

I hope us will cooperate with each other!

Thanks!
